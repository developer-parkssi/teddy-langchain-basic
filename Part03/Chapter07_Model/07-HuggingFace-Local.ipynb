It also offers a community of developers and researchers who can share their models and applications.\\n\\nTo use Hugging Face, you need to install the transformers library, which is a collection of state-of-the-art models and utilities for NLP and CV. You can install it using pip:\\n\\n```\\npip install transformers\\n```\\n\\nThen, you can import the models you want to use from the transformers library. For example, to use the BERT model for text classification, you can import it as follows:\\n\\n```\\nfrom transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer\\n```\\n\\nThe BERT model is a pre-trained model that can perform various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering. The model consists of two parts: the encoder and the classifier. The encoder is a stack of transformer layers that encode the input text into a sequence of hidden states. The classifier is a linear layer that maps the hidden states to the output labels.\\n\\nTo use'"
